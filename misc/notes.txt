- Change storage of cieLab colors to reflect graphing... {a*, L*, b*)
- Keep 2D pips in bounds
- Fix BX_CHECK
- Display image
- Figure out why making MemPtr using OH_MK_MEMPTR causes heap corruption
- Embed resources using cog
- Change shaders (UGH)
- Replace Sample ImGui rendering:
- Rendering: Use Cog for creating inline binaries
- BUILD: Revise + integrate cog?
- Inline varying.def.sc
- Use min/max color constants
- Don't let spectrum be transparent
- Draw cursor without squash
- More disagreement on eulers/quat/mtx conversions... debug!! Replace MtxFromTf3d with consistent-but-slow func
- NEEDS TO BE A FULL FLEDGED TEST
- Display cursors properly

- New TF at root has L=50
- Reset tf button
- Work with decomp
- Remove unused palette entries
- Resize image view
- Edit by clicking in spectrum

-=NOPE=-
- #define GARBAGE(_x) ((__attr__ uninitialized))0
- Name and pointer for IMGUI
- macro away "const"
- #define ImTextureId
- BUILD: Change build from python + header to just one of the two??
- Keep 1D pips in bounds (doesn't matter probably)
- Restrict palette to 16 colors ??
- Dragdrop preview
- Pip icon based on id hash (numbers, letters, symbols)
- Metaprogram shader input structs like in other project
